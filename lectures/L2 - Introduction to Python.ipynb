    "## Part 1: Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's history\n",
    "\n",
    "Python as a language was implemented from the start by Guido van Rossum [1]. What was originally something of a [snarkily-named hobby project to pass the holidays](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/) turned into a huge open source phenomenon used by millions. The original project began in 1989, with the release of Python 2.0 in 2000 and Python 3.0 in 2008. As of this lecture, the latest stable releases of these branches are 2.7.11--which Guido *emphatically* insists is the final, final, final release of the 2.x branch--and 3.5.1 (which is what we're using in this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're (rightly!) wondering why a 2.x branch has survived a decade and a half after its initial release, there is indeed a story there. In short, Python 3 was designed as backwards-incompatible; a good number of syntax changes and other internal improvements made the majority of code written for Python 2 unusable in Python 3. We'll go over one of these examples, but suffice to say this made it difficult for power users and developers to upgrade, particularly when they relied on so many third-party libraries for much of the heavy-lifting in Python; until these third-party libraries were themselves converted to Python 3, most developers stuck with Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As a language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an *interpreted* language. Those of you who have some prior programming experience may recognize this term; it means the code you write is directly translated and \"interpreted\" by the computer into 1s and 0s that are executed on the CPU. Often in contrast, *compiled* languages, such as C, are first compiled into binary executables of machine code that are then run by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this distinction has become blurry, particularly in the past decade. Interpreted languages *in general* are easier to use but run more slowly and consume more resources; compiled languages *in general* are more difficult to program in, but run much more efficiently. As a result of these advantages and disadvantages, modern programming languages have attempted to combine the best of both worlds:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Java is initially compiled into bytecode, which is then run through the Java Virtual Machine which acts as an interpreter. In this sense, it is both a compiled language and an interpreted language.\n",
    " - Python runs on a reference implementation, CPython, in which chunks of Python code are compiled into intermediate representations and executed.\n",
    " - [Julia](http://julialang.org/), a relative newcomer in programming languages designed for scientific computing and data science, straddles a middle ground in a different way: using a \"just-in-time\" (JIT) compilation scheme, whereby code is compiled as the program runs, theoretically providing the performance of compiled programs with the ease of use of interpreted programs. JIT compilers have proliferated for other languages as well, including Python.\n",
    " \n",
    "An important point to keep in mind about Python: it is not designed as a specialized language for performing a specific task. It does not have numerical and statistical tools embedded into the core language itself; instead, the Python community relies on third-party developers to provide these extras (XKCD, of course, [played off this facet of Python](https://xkcd.com/353/)). Instead, as Jake VanderPlas put it [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Python syntax is the glue that holds your data science code together. As many scientists and statisticians have found, Python excels in that role because it is powerful, intuitive, quick to write, fun to use, and above all extremely useful in day-to-day data science tasks.\"\n",
    " \n",
    "### Zen of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest reasons for Python's popularity, and for my decision in using it in this course, is its overall simplicity and ease of use, especially for individuals with little to no prior programming experience. This is no coincidence: Python was designed explicitly with this in mind. It's so central to the Python ethos, in fact, that it's baked into every Python installation. Tim Peters wrote a \"poem\" of sorts, *The Zen of Python*, that anyone with Python installed can read. To see it, just type one line of Python code:"

You can think of it as a direct analog of the mathematical term, $f(x) = y$. In this case, $f()$ is the function; $x$ is the input, and $y$ is the output.

In this case, there is only one argument to `print()`: a string of text that we want printed out. This text, in Python parlance, is called a \"string\". I can only presume it is so named because it is a *string* of individual characters.\n",

However, 5 is known internally to Python as a \"literal.\" This is pretty much what it sounds like--it has a literal value that cannot be changed through assignment. When we try, Python complains and crashes its program with an error message.\n",

    "All notebook lectures will be posted to the course GitHub repository here: **https://github.com/quinngroup/csci1360e-su16**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute the notebooks and make them interactive (i.e., you can change the code in them and re-execute it to see the results), you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Do it yourself**: If you've already completed A0 and opted to install the Anaconda Python environment, you can host these notebooks yourself.\n",
    " \n",
    "  1. Download the contents of the above repository. You can do this by clicking the green \"Clone or download\" button and selecting \"Download ZIP\". Extract the archive somewhere on your computer.\n",
    "  2. Open up a command prompt / Terminal window. Within the shell, navigate to the folder you just extracted.\n",
    "  3. Run the command: `jupyter notebook` and press `Enter`. This will initialize the Jupyter notebook environment, and should immediately spawn a web server you can view through your browser (`http://localhost:8888`). Provided you're in the correct directory, you should see a file with the extension `.ipynb` (for \"**IPy**thon **N**ote**b**ook, where \"IPython\" means \"Interactive Python\"). Click on that, and Jupyter should immediately render the notebook in interactive mode!\n",
    "  4. When you're finished, just go back to your command prompt and press `CTRL+C` to kill the Jupyter process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Use mybinder**: A wonderful tool out of HHMI Janelia Farms, [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) will host GitHub repositories with notebooks in them through their own servers. Since the GitHub repository is already set up, all you have to do to launch the notebooks is:\n",
    " \n",
    "  1. Go to the `csci1360e-su16` repository linked above in your web browser.\n",
    "  2. Click the \"launch binder\" badge you see on the front page. It may take some time to spin up, but it will eventually provide you an interactive interface to the notebooks.\n",
    " \n",
    "To interact with the notebooks, double-click on the section you want to edit. Once you've completed your edits and way to re-evaluate the cell, click the button the toolbar at the top that looks like a \"play\" button (just to the left of the \"stop\" button). The cell will execute, and any output will be displayed right below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, instead of editing existing cells, you want to add new ones: click the \"Insert\" drop-down menu and select where you'd like to add a new cell. You can then select what type of cell you want with the selectable drop-down; if you're writing Python, you'll want to select the `Code` option."
