Put something between those quotes. Anything at all. The autograder for this question will literally look to see if there's so much as a single blank space between the quotes, and will call the answer correct. `\" \"` would be correct; so would `\"this is a lot more than just a space\"`. Make something up! But whatever you do, *don't delete the quotes*."
